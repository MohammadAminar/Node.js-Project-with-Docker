# Node.js Project with Docker

This is a Node.js project containerized using Docker. The project includes a simple Node.js application and a Docker setup for easy development and deployment.

## Project Structure

```

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohammadAminar/Node.js-Project-with-Docker.git
   cd Node.js-Project-with-Docker

2. **Build and run the project using Docker Compose**:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
This command will:
- Build the Docker image for the Node.js app.

- Start the application and any linked services (e.g., database).

3. **Access the application**:
Once the containers are running, you can access the Node.js app at `http://localhost` (or the port specified in your configuration).

4. **Stop the containers**:
To stop the running containers, use:
```
docker-compose down
```

# Docker Configuration
**`Dockerfile`** </br>
The `Dockerfile` in the `app` directory is used to build the Node.js application image. It includes steps to install dependencies and start the application.

**`docker-compose.yml`**
The docker-compose.yml file defines the services for the project. It typically includes:
- A service for the Node.js app.

- A service for the database (if applicable).

- Volume configurations for persistent data storage.

Example `docker-compose.yml`:
```
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build: ./app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./app:/usr/src/app
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: development
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    volumes:
      - ./volumes/db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb
```

## Volumes
The `volumes/db` directory is used to persist database data. This ensures that data is not lost when the container is stopped or restarted.
